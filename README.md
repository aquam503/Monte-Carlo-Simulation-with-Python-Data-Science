# Monte Carlo Simulations: Estimating Pi and Expected Game Rounds

This repository contains a Python notebook (`montee_carlo.ipynb`) showcasing the use of Monte Carlo simulations for two distinct purposes:
1. Estimating the value of \(\pi\).
2. Calculating the expected number of rounds before losing two consecutive times in a game, given a certain probability of winning each round.

## Overview

The project demonstrates the versatility of Monte Carlo simulations in solving different types of problems - from estimating mathematical constants to analyzing game outcomes based on probability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system, along with the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `random`

These can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib random
